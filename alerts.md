## Unexpected exceptions 

### 10:02 AM, 13-Apr-17: UPS failure

Our UPS unit went down some time last night causing a power failure on all systems. Jordan is bypassing the UPS to bring things back up in the next
few hours. Nationwide Power will come in asap to repair the UPS. This failure has not resulted in any overheating problems since the AC units
are running on a different power cricuit.

Updates will be posted here...
