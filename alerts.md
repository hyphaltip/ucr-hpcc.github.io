## Unannounced exceptions 

### 10:02 AM, 13-Apr-17: UPS failure

Our UPS unit went down some time last night causing a power failure on all systems. Jordan is bypassing the UPS to bring things back up in the next
few hours. Nationwide Power will come in asap to repair the UPS. Note, this failure has not resulted in any overheating problems since the AC units
are running on a different power cricuit.

Once users are able to log into the cluster again, it may not be a good idea to start very long running jobs (over several days/weeks) until we know whether the repair 
of the UPS will require a power shutdown in the next few days. 

Updates will be posted here...
