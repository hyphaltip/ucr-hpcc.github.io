## Welcome

Our facility's mission is to provide...

## Services

The HPCC provides access to high-performance compute resources, data analysis and programming expertise.
The resources serve scientists at UC Riverside to master the bigdata and informatics needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner. 
The following services are offered:

  * Development and maintenance of a high-performance informatics hardware and software infrastructure for our research community at UCR.
  * Instruction of hands-on tutorials and workshops on cluster usage. Extensive manuals for these tutorials are available on our manual page.
  * Establishment of research collaborations with experimental scientists from different departments.

## Facility Description

Our high performance computing infrastructure is located in the Genomics Cluster Farm.
It provides access to enterprise level high-performance computing resources, for data analysis and programming.
These resources serve the scientists at UC Riverside, and elsewhere, to master big compute and big data needs of their research in a proficient and cost-effective manner.
We also host a broad range of free workshops on proper cluster utilization that provides a strong training component to successful grants.
