* An FAU for the annual registration fee (see below) is required if a PI's lab is not registered yet.

# Annual Registration Fee

The annual registration fee of $1,000 gives all members of an UCR lab access to our high-performance computing infrastructure.
The registration provides access to the following resources: 

  * Over 4.500 CPU cores, ~2PB disk space, 512GB-1TB of memory/node, etc. More details are available on the hardware page.

# Ownership models

* Disk storage
        
    * Lab purchases storage hardware (hard drives) according to the specifications of the facility. Owned hard drives will be added to the facilities parallel GPFS storage system. The annual support fee for owned disk storage is $250 per 10TB of usable and backed-up storage space. 
    * Owned storage can be attractive for labs with storage needs above 40 TBs.

* Compute nodes
        
    * Lab purchases computer nodes according to the specifications of the facility. 
    * Owned computer nodes are an attractive solution for labs requiring 24/7 access to hundreds of CPU cores with no or only minor waiting times in queue.
