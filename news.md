* With funding provided by Michael Pazzani (RED) we were able to purchase and install a major hardware upgrades in Feb 2017. This included the following resources:

    * Added 28 Intel computer nodes each with a total of 896 CPU cores or 1,792 logical CPU cores
    * Added 8 NVIDIA K80 GPUs increasing total number of cuda cores in GPU queue to 59,904
    * Redesign if Infiniband network to support new computer nodes and enhance scalabilty of network to over 500 nodes

* We apologize to users for the downtimes of the cluster these upgrades required. Due to the scheduling challenges with our electircians and the vendor we only able to provide short notice for these downtimes. However, we are sure that the new computing resources are a value to all users.
