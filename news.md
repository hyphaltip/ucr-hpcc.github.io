### Feb 2017

With funding provided by Michael Pazzani's office (RED) we were able to purchase and install major hardware upgrades. This included the following hardware resources:

    * Added 28 Intel computer nodes each with a total of 896 CPU cores (or 1,792 logical CPU cores)
    * Added 8 NVIDIA K80 GPUs increasing total number of cuda cores in GPU queue to 59,904
    * Redesign if Infiniband network to support new computer nodes and enhance future scalabilty of IB network to over 1000 nodes

* We apologize to users for the downtimes of the cluster these upgrades required. Due to the scheduling challenges with our electircians and the vendor, we were only able to provide very little advance notice for these downtimes. However, we are sure that the new computing resources will be a great value to all users of our cluster.
