## What software is installed?

There are hundreds of software tools installed on HPCC's systems. Most software is administered under our module system. To find out what software is installed, run the following command.

```bash
module avail
```

More details on this is available on the HPCC manual pages [here](http://hpcc.ucr.edu/manuals_linux-cluster_intro.html).

## Software install requests

* Registered users can email software install requests to HPCC's issue tracking system @ [support@biocluster.ucr.edu](mailto:support@biocluster.ucr.edu). Install requests are addressed in the order received. Simple installs are addressed within 1 to a few days. Complex installs may take longer.
